I am a cybersecurity enthusiast building foundational skills in security operations, log analysis, and basic security automation using Python. My technical practice includes beginner-level SIEM exploration and Linux security fundamentals. I am seeking an internship opportunity to start developing SOC analyst experience as I work toward a future specialization in security orchestration and automation.

## Objective
My objective is to build practical cybersecurity knowledge through hands-on learning and project development, with a focus on security operations, log analysis, and basic security automation. I am seeking opportunities to grow my technical skills, contribute to security-focused tasks, and gain real-world experience as I work toward a career in SOC analysis and security orchestration and automation.
